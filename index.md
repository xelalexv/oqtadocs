#### *Microdrive* Emulator for *Spectrum* & *QL*

![OqtaDrive]({{site.baseurl}}/images/oq-standalone.jpg)

This is the *OqtaDrive* landing page. Hopefully, it will help you decide whether *OqtaDrive* is something worth building, and if so, how to get started. Beyond that, the [project home at GitHub](https://github.com/xelalexv/oqtadrive) is the authoritative source for all information about *OqtaDrive*. We will try not to duplicate too much of that information here. Instead we provide pointers into the *GitHub* project to make it more approachable, and supplement information on topics not covered there.
