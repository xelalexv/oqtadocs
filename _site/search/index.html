If you want to combine OqtaDrive with hardware Microdrive units, then there are essentially two choices for placing the OqtaDrive adapter - either at the end of the drive chain or at the start. Here are a few considerations and pros &amp; cons for both options. Last in Chain Pros simple - adapter just plugs into the Interface 1, QL, or Microdrive unit edge connector requires just one edge connector plug no hardware modifications needed Cons hardware Microdrive units are always upstream of the adapter, and cannot be turned off or mapped into different slots; on the QL for example this means that OqtaDrive can only emulate mdv3 through mdv8 First in Chain Pros hardware Microdrive units can be freely moved as a group within the chain, or turned off completely To take advantage of drive mapping, you need to route the COMMS_OUT signal from the adapter to the COMMS input of the first of the hardware drives, and make a couple of settings in the config section at the top of arduino oqtadrive.ino. Tom Dalby’s Micro and Standalone PCBs (see build section) are prepared for this. Cons requires an additional edge connector (plug) for connecting hardware Microdrive units; alternatively, the adapter can be installed into an Interface 1 or QL, but cannot be used with other machines in that case for the QL, this requires modifying the hardware"

						"content": "What is OqtaDrive? OqtaDrive emulates a bank of up to 8 Microdrives for use with a Sinclair Spectrum with Interface 1, or with a QL. The goal is to functionally create a faithful reproduction of the original. On the Spectrum QL side, operating the emulated Microdrives should feel exactly the same as using the real thing. So by definition, it does not try to compete with more “modern day” mass storage solutions for Spectrum and QL. OqtaDrive is built around an Arduino that connects via its GPIO ports to the Microdrive interface and via serial connection to a daemon running on a host machine. This daemon host could be anything, ranging from your PC to a small embedded board such as a RaspberryPi Zero, as long as it can run a supported OS (Linux, MacOS, Windows). The same Arduino can be used with both Spectrum and QL, without any reconfiguration. The adapter itself does not provide a UI. Instead the daemon exposes a REST API endpoint. This can be used by different tools for controlling the daemon. Currently, there’s a command line tool and a web UI. Just open it in your browser, be it on your PC or your phone, and load your cartridges. What Can I Do With This? OqtaDrive’s architecture makes it very flexible, so many setups are possible. The simplest one would be just the Arduino that connects your Interface 1 or QL with your PC or Mac, and you manage everything from there. If you’re rather looking for a standalone solution, you could for example run the daemon on a RaspberryPi Zero W, and place this into a Microdrive or 3D printed case. Have a look at the build section for available options. Feature Overview Supports all Microdrive operations on Spectrum with Interface 1 and on QL, no modifications or additional software required Can co-exist with actual hardware Microdrive units, which can be mapped on demand to any slot in the drive chain or turned off Daemon can run on Linux, MacOS, and Windows Control daemon via command line interface and web UI Load &amp; save from to MDR and MDV formatted cartridge files For Spectrum, Z80 and SNA snapshot files can be directly loaded, no additional software required All supported formats can also be loaded from zip, gzip, and 7z compressed files Directly load cartridge files from the web Store your cartridge collection on the daemon host and search &amp; load from any client Connect a rumble motor for authentic sound ;-) List virtual drives &amp; contents of cartridges Hex dump cartridge contents for inspection Due to the minimal hardware required, OqtaDrive is also very cost-efficient. In the simplest setup, you only need an Arduino Nano and a few resistors and diodes. Additionally, if you own a Spectrum and a QL, you can use it with both, no need to have dedicated adapters. But above all, there’s the fun involved in building this!"

						"content": "All Your Cartridges at Your Fingertips You can store your collection of cartridges and snapshots in a so-called repo on the daemon host. This is essentially just a designated folder where you place them. When set up, you can instruct the daemon to directly load files from this repo, rather than uploading them. This feature really shines when you use it with the standalone configuration (see build section) - all your Spectrum and QL cartridge images ready to load in one little box. Searching Through the Repo OqtaDrive lets you search through the names of the files in the repo, from the command line and the web UI. For quick search results, in particular incremental search in the web UI, the daemon automatically maintains an index of the file names, keeping track of any file changes (addition, removal, rename, move). So searching through a collection with even thousands of files is quick. Search Terms Here are the rules for searching and search terms. By default whole words in the file name are matched: pac man - anything with pac or man +pac man - same, but pac is now required +pac +man - anything with pac and man +pac -man - anything with pac but not man Use * for globbing: pac* - anything with a word that starts with pac *man - anything with a word that ends in man To use regular expressions, enclose the term in forward slashes: 19(84|85) - any file with 1984 or 1985 More details here"

						"content": "Before building OqtaDrive yourself, please carefully read the hardware section at the project home! It contains important instructions &amp; notes. Not following these may break your vintage machine and or the Arduino! However, bear in mind that all the information here and at the project home is published in good faith and for general information purpose only. I do not make any warranties about the completeness, reliability, and accuracy of this information. Any action you take upon the information you find here, is strictly at your own risk. I will not be liable for any losses and or damages in connection with the use of OqtaDrive. If you just want to try out OqtaDrive, you can simply build the adapter on a breadboard, following the schematics. The circuit is not very complicated and can be set up quickly. If you rather want to build a proper device for continued use with your Spectrum and QL, Tom Dalby has created several PCBs and 3D print models of cases for different configurations you can choose from. Clicking on the PCB images or photos below will take you the respective resources on PCBWay, Thingiverse, GitHub, or wherever the corresponding artifacts are maintained. Micro This is the smallest member of the OqtaDrive PCB family created by Tom. If you’re planning on running the daemon on your PC or Mac, and want the smallest possible adapter, this is the one. It works with Spectrum and QL. Tom also created a 3D print model for a case. Lite &amp; Mini These two PCB were early prototypes created by Tom. They are included here for completeness, to show the evolution of PCB development. The Lite and Mini are a little large than the Micro, and have two edge connectors, one for Spectrum and one for QL. This has the advantage that the rear of the unit with the USB connector will always point to the back when you connect to either one. That’s because an Interface 1 has its edge connector on the left hand side, the QL on the right hand side. The rumble motor is not supported on these PCBs, as they were created before that feature was added. Otherwise, there’s no difference with the Micro. Standalone for Spectrum and QL This is the fully fledged, complete solution including a RaspberryPi Zero W (1 or 2) for running the daemon. Great choice if you want a self contained setup you can use with your Spectrum and or QL, away from your PC or Mac. A 3D print model for a case is available as well. The PCB however also fits into the original Microdrive case. Using an Arduino Pro Mini Since in the standalone configuration, the USB port of the Arduino Nano is not needed, it’s also possible to use an Arduino Pro Mini instead, which comes without the USB port. It’s important to note the different pin out though. It’s not a drop-in replacement! A few patch wires however are enough to fix this (pins D10, D11, D12, A0, and A4). In below example, the D10 and A0 pins of the Pro Mini were not fitted, since they would otherwise connect with the wrong signals on the PCB (A0 and A4) and block the patch wires. Software-wise the Pro Mini is fully compatible. QL Add On This PCB is installed into the case of the QL, the right choice if you want OqtaDrive permanently available in your QL. It replaces drive 1, but drive 2 can still be used and freely assigned to any drive number, or turned off. Tom also designed a 3D printed mounting bracket for the installation. Other Options I personally also installed an OqtaDrive adapter into an Interface 1, handwiring the necessary connections. The Arduino Nano fits nicely between the serial port and network connectors."

						"id": "02-getting-started-configure",
						"title": "Configure",
						"category": "",
						"url": " /02.getting-started/configure/",
						"content": "Adapter Static Configuration The adapter recognizes what it’s plugged in to, i.e. Interface 1 or QL. But it’s also possible to force a particular machine. Have a look at the config section at the top of oqtadrive.ino. There are a few more settings that can be changed. If you need to maintain several configs for various adapters, you can alternatively place your settings in separate header files and include as needed. The details for this are also explained in the config section of oqtadrive.ino. Note: Whenever you make config changes, whether directly in oqtadrive.ino or in a config header file, don’t forget to flash the firmware again. Dynamic Configuration A few adapter settings can also be changed on the fly via the oqtactl command (in the future also via the web UI). These settings are: Client setting, i.e. whether the adapter is connected to an Interface 1 or a QL. This can be set with the --client option, when starting the daemon or when forcing a resync (see oqtactl serve --help and oqtactl resync --help). Mapping of hardware drives, unless HW_GROUP_LOCK in oqtadrive.ino is set to true (see oqtactl map --help). Rumble level of the vibration motor, if installed (see oqtactl config --help). Daemon &amp; Command The oqtactl binary gets all its configuration from the passed command line arguments. Several of these arguments can alternatively be provided as environment variables. See oqtactl {action} --help to find out which settings support this, and for the names of the variables. For example, the oqtactl serve command accepts an --address argument that allows you to set the address and port on which the daemon listens. If you change this setting from the default, you need to provide it whenever you run oqtactl to query or control the daemon. Since this can be quite tedious, you can set the address and port in environment variable OQTADRIVE_ADDRESS, e.g. in your .bashrc file if you’re on Linux (Windows and MacOS provide ways of doing that as well, but I’m not familiar with those): export OQTADRIVE_ADDRESS=oqtadrive-box:8080 The setting would now be automatically picked up when the daemon is started with oqtactl serve, as well as with any other invocation of oqtactl that needs to communicate with the daemon. You no longer need to specify the --address argument."

						"category": "",
						"url": " /02.getting-started/install/",
						"content": "Installation Script In the hack folder of the project, there’s a Makefile that can perform all necessary installation steps. Currently, this only supports installation on Linux. For more details, have a look at the install guide. I highly recommend using the installer, since it’s easy to make mistakes when doing the installation manually. But above all, it can also upgrade an existing installation. So it’s easy to stay up to date with the latest releases. Run make without any options for detailed info about what the installer can do, and what settings you can make. If using the installer is really not an option, refer to the following steps. Adapter Firmware The OqtaDrive firmware needs to be flashed onto the Arduino. For this you can use for example the Arduino IDE, or if you’re comfortable working with the command line, the arduino-cli. You find released versions of the firmware on the release page, and the latest unreleased version here. OqtaDrive Daemon &amp; Control Command There is a single binary oqtactl. It can be run as the daemon to take care of everything that needs to be done on the daemon host side. It can also be run as a command to control the daemon, on the same host or over the network. The release page has oqtactl binaries for Linux, MacOS and Windows, available for different architectures. Download, extract, and copy the appropriate binary onto the daemon host and any other system from which you want to use it. Daemon as systemd Service (optional) If you want to automatically start the daemon whenever the daemon host boots, you can enable it as a systemd service. This of course only works if the Linux system is using systemd as its init system, which is the case with Raspberry Pi OS on the Pi. Create the following unit file, e.g. in etc systemd system oqtadrive.service (as root), adjusting the place holders for user and serial port accordingly: [Unit] Description=OqtaDrive Daemon After=local-fs.target sysinit.target [Service] #Environment=LOG_LEVEL=debug OQTADRIVE_ADDRESS=oqtadrive-box:8080 ExecStart= home {user} oqtactl serve -d {serial port to use} {extra arguments, if needed} WorkingDirectory= home {user} StandardOutput=inherit StandardError=inherit Restart=always User=someone [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target If you want to set environment variables, for example to set debug log level, uncomment the Environment line and add variables as required. The list is space separated. Assignments that include space characters therefore need to be placed in double quotes. To finally activate the service, run: sudo systemctl enable oqtadrive.service sudo systemctl start oqtadrive.service You can check on the status of the service with: systemctl status oqtadrive.service Logs can be retrieved with: sudo journalctl -u oqtadrive Whenever you change the unit file, do this to activate the changes: sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl restart oqtadrive.service Web UI The OqtaDrive web UI is served by the daemon. If you want to enable it, extract the content of the ui.zip archive from the release page into the same directory where the oqtactl binary is located on the daemon host. When the daemon starts, it will pick up the UI resources and start serving the web UI on port 8888 by default. Have a look at oqtactl serve --help on how to change that."

						"content": "Use the Log, Luke! Whenever you hit a problem, first thing to do is to check the daemon log. For this, run the daemon preferably with debug log level, e.g.: LOG_LEVEL=debug oqtactl serve -d dev ttyUSB0 [other options] If you’re running the daemon as a systemd service, you need to edit the unit file accordingly, and restart the service. For many problems, the daemon log should already give you good hints about what’s going on. It’s also important when reporting an issue over at GitHub. Check the Online Help The oqtactl binary provides online help for all actions. Just run oqtactl --help to get a list of the available actions, and oqtactl {action} --help for finding out more about a particular action. Maybe there are additional options that you weren’t aware of, and that can help you work around a problem. Make Sure OqtaDrive Correctly Recognizes Your Machine When the OqtaDrive adapter starts up, it auto-detects what it’s connected to, i.e. Interface 1 or QL, and configures itself accordingly. This may fail in certain situations, so it’s one of the first things to check. The daemon log and also the web UI show what machine has been detected. If this is incorrect, re-sync the adapter, either via the web UI or oqtactl resync. The latter method also allows you to force a particular machine with the --client option. If you’re always using the adapter with only one type of machine, you can also hard-code that in the adapter config. Check the config section at the top of oqtadrive.ino, and look for the FORCE_IF1 and FORCE_QL settings. You can also force a particular machine with the --client option when starting the daemon. Tip: When using the adapter with a Spectrum + Interface 1, make sure to power up the adapter after or together with the Spectrum, but not before. Otherwise it will auto-detect a QL. Common Issues Check this list of common issues at the project home. Check GitHub Issues &amp; Discussions If you can’t resolve the problem, have a look at reported issues and discussions at the project home. Maybe the problem you’re seeing has been reported and discussed before. If that doesn’t yield anything, consider starting a discussion yourself, or if you’re sure what you’re seeing is a bug, open an issue."

						"content": "Approach I’ve always been fascinated by the Microdrive technology. In particular it’s the approach of using mass-produced components from other products (e.g. audio head from cassette tape decks as read write head), to create an inexpensive solution that could -at least somewhat- compete with the much more expensive floppy disk drives common at the time. The emulator should therefore be designed in the same spirit, and use as few and cheap components as possible. The Arduino Nano seemed to be the right choice for that. If it all possible, it should also be the only major component in the design, not counting resistors, diodes, and connectors. This design goal shaped OqtaDrive’s structure: The Arduino takes the part of a protocol converter between the Microdrive interface and a daemon process running on a host machine, that manages Microdrive data. One advantage with this is that no storage components (e.g. SD card reader) and no UI components (LCD screen, buttons) are needed, since the daemon can be easily controlled form the daemon host. Another advantage is that the daemon host will usually be connected to a network, opening up interesting opportunities for use and further development of the emulator. Format First I had to find out how the Microdrive records data, to estimate whether this could be pulled off with an Arduino Nano in the first place. There is a lot of information available, but of course it’s also fun to supplement this with a bit of research of your own. I started with the Spectrum, by looking at the signals of the Microdrive port on the Interface 1 while formatting a cartridge. Data is written on two tracks, with above mentioned stereo cassette tape head. Bytes are alternating between the two tracks, with an offset of four bits against each other. One bit is 12µs long. A 0 is signaled by no level change during the duration of the bit (approx. 41kHz), and a 1 by a level change at 6µs from start of bit (approx. 83kHz). Next up was the logical format, for which the Spectrum Microdrive Book by Ian Logan was particularly helpful. A cartridge is organized in up to 254 sectors. Each sector consists of a 27 byte header and a 540 byte data record, separated by short gaps (3.75ms after a header, 7.0ms after a record). This was also the greatest challenge: The RAM of the Arduino Nano (2KB) is far too small to hold a complete cartridge (144KB). So data has to be continuously passed back and forth between Nano and daemon. At a bit rate of 1Mb s over the serial connection that should at least theoretically be possible. Luckily, my first trials showed that the connection remains stable at this speed. After a few more experiments the big moment had come - for the first time I could correctly receive all sectors while formatting a cartridge. Prototypes The first success in communicating with the Microdrive interface was followed by a long phase of prototyping, both for hardware as well as firmware for the Arduino Nano and the daemon software. Over many iterations and refactorings, a first version of the emulator gradually evolved, which supported all the features of the original Microdrive, but for the time being only for the Spectrum. QL Support After the prototyping phase, I suspended work on the project for quite some time, due to changed priorities. In early 2021 though, two discussions over at World of Spectrum sparked my interest again. I resumed work on the project and started to get it into shape for publication. The biggest still missing part was support for the Sinclair QL. My goal was to avoid creating a separate variant of the emulator. That is, the same adapter should work with both Spectrum and QL, ideally with auto detect. This meant back to research &amp; experimentation, since it became quickly evident that after all there are quite a few differences between Spectrum and QL Microdrives: Starting with a higher data rate (50 100kHz), swapped tracks and shorter gaps after headers and records, over a changed logical structure, all the way to a completely different format procedure, there were many surprises. OqtaDrive’s architecture proved helpful in tackling all of this. Many of the necessary changes could be addressed in the daemon, which in terms of software development was much easier to do. And finally, another big moment - first successful format with the QL. Open Sourcing Beginning of May 2021 support for the QL was complete and the adapter could automatically detect Spectrum and QL, as desired. After many refactorings the code base was also cleaned up enough to warrant publishing on GitHub. From the start it was important to me to make this project available under a free license, so anyone interested in this could build it. By open sourcing, OqtaDrive could also win the first contributors. Tom Dalby designed several PCBs for various configurations along with models for 3D printing cases - from a standalone config with Raspberry Pi onboard to a minimal micro version. Stephan Preuß relentlessly tested many pre-releases, on Spectrum and QL, and found quite a few bugs. And not to forget all the discussions that sprang up over the collaboration, which were important for the direction of OqtaDrive. For example, initially I wasn’t really interested in an standalone config that could be controlled via a web UI. But due to Tom’s and Stephan’s suggestions and friendly nudging, this is today my favorite config."

						"content": "The Sinclair ZX Microdrive is a magnetic mass storage media, that uses small endless tape cartridges. It was initially released as an external drive for the ZX Spectrum in 1983. The Sinclair QL, released one year later, came with two internal Microdrives installed. Already back then, Microdrives were regarded as somewhat unreliable, which makes working with them quite challenging today, decades later. In particular the tape cartridges are often no longer usable. This prompted the development of a Microdrive emulator. Different from existing “modern day” mass storage solutions for Spectrum &amp; QL, the goal was to create a fully transparent and “historically correct” emulation of the Microdrive. Using this emulator should not feel different from using a real Microdrive. For that reason, it works on the level of the hardware Microdrive interface, and does not employ any system hooks on the Spectrum QL."
